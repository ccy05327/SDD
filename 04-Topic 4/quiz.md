- Requirements focus on hitting a certain condition/criteria and the respective outcome, unit tests, however, focus on the result/output's correctness. 

    > Requirements are expectations of what a given piece of software should do. They can be written in a variety of forms, from natural language to formal specifications. Unit tests are similar in that they are a set of tests that evaluate if a piece of software is doing what it is supposed to do. In a sense, unit tests are a combination of requirement specification and automated testing against those requirements.
